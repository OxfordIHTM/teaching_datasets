| bateman.dat              | DAT       | On Saturday, 21st April 1990, a luncheon was held in the home of Jean Bateman. There was a total of forty-five guests which included thirty-five members of the Department of Epidemiology and Population Sciences at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. On Sunday morning, 22nd April 1990, Jean awoke with symptoms of gastrointestinal illness; her husband awoke with similar symptoms. The possibility of an outbreak related to the luncheon was strengthened when several of the guests telephoned Jean on Sunday and reported illness. On Monday, 23rd April 1990, there was an unusually large number of department members absent from work and reporting illness. Data from this outbreak is stored in this dataset. | Useful for learning and practicing how to perform logistic regression                                                                                               |
